- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st

Update 1:
Worked on the general outline of the printer and its basic architecture in CAD. Decided to go simple with a bedslinger design with a 180mm cubed build volume.

Update 2:
Started working on the BOM and figure out my constraints for electronics and component selection to help me figure out my design. Need to continue narrowing down options for the Mainboard and extruder. I do know I want to use Klipper so that helps.

Update 3:
I should really update more often so my bad but I worked a lot on the design and I am switching to the MKS Robin Nano series for the main board and a direct drive extruder. I am also using mostly 2020 extrusion and nema17 motors, and igus linear rails for support and rigidity.
