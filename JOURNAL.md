- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st

Update 1:
Worked on the general outline of the printer and its basic architecture in CAD. Decided to go simple with a bedslinger design with a 180mm cubed build volume.

Update 2:
Started working on the BOM and figure out my constraints for electronics and component selection to help me figure out my design. Need to continue narrowing down options for the Mainboard and extruder. I do know I want to use Klipper so that helps.

Update 3:
I should really update more often so my bad but I worked a lot on the design and I am switching to the MKS Robin Nano series for the main board and a direct drive extruder. I am also using mostly 2020 extrusion and nema17 motors, and igus linear rails for support and rigidity.

Update 4: 
Using an LDO orbiter extruder and High Temp hotend to hopefully print some cool engineering filaments. I also am confirmed making a 150mm x 150mm build volume Z height is TBD but prob more than 150mm. I am cadding the main structure and how/where I want the electronics to be roughly. I'll refine it as I design more.

Update 5:
I started finding more parts like belts and pulleys as well as an ABL probe, gonna use the BTT microprobe. I'm also narrowing down my selection of motors, I will use E Series Nema 17 42Ncm motors. I also found a good PSU hopefully it doesn't blow up in my face. I also worked on more CAD to implement all the new components.

Update 6:
I started adding up all the prices for parts and it's not looking good, slightly above 300 so ima switch some things up. I was thinking of doing a 180mm bed again but I want the printer to be small so that it can be focused on precision. I'm starting to work on mounts for the extruder and hot end, and the electronics bay.
